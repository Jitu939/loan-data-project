# loan-data-project
It is excel project based on the loan data. In these project I have performed various analysis using the charts to get the insights from data.
Enabled better decisions through visual analytics and performing the EDA. 
Created visualizations like loan taken by age, transaction percentage etc using charts like bar, histogram , pie and also used slicers to filter data by education and gender. 
Enabled decision makers to identify patterns in loan approval and repayments.
